# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Christophe VG](https://christophe.vg) and these repositories contain my serious and less serious code ramblings. My interests are mainly focused on software development as a trade and tooling to get things done.

I'm basically on this eternal quest to create my personal stack to be able to quickly create whatever little application crosses my mind. Because they come across often and fast, if I'm not done quickly enough, they end up somewhere in /dev/null ðŸ˜‡

Since the early 80s, programming languages have always had an enormous attractive force on me, making me explore every single one I could lay my hands on. Many I'd like to erase from my memory (Visual Basic, Java, C#, yes I'm talking about you!) Notable highlights that got some appreciation over time included PHP, Javascript, C,.. and around 2013 [Python](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Achristophevg+language%3APython&type=code) entered my [editor](https://macromates.com). Just like MacOS, it felt like the "where-have-you-been-all-my-life" experience all over again, making all other languages feel like some form of masochism ðŸ˜ˆ

Currently my (ever changing) focus is on the pinned repos below:

* [bpmn-tools](https://github.com/christophevg/bpmn-tools) - my collection of Python modules to work with BPMN. After a few rounds of prototyping, I'm currently working on a [1.0 target](https://github.com/christophevg/bpmn-tools/tree/redesign). After that I hope to revive [UmlCanvas](https://github.com/christophevg/umlcanvas) to the likes of [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io).
* [pypi-template](https://github.com/christophevg/pypi-template) - my semi-biased/personal template-based set of common & best practices for managing a Python project/package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/christophe.vg/) - I like consistency, so most of my (Python) projects/repos are based on it
* [baseweb](https://github.com/christophevg/baseweb) - my unholy matrimony of Python and [Vue(tify)](https://vuetifyjs.com), also known as my personal ultra-rapid web-application development environment, bringing together the basic and standardized technologies that I feel are appropriate for what I need to do at a given time (read: Python, Flask, OAuth, REST, SocketIO, Vue, Vuetify, JavaScript). I also try to keep [baseweb-demo](https://github.com/christophevg/baseweb-demo) up to date with the latest additions, yet YMMV.
* [human-parser-generator](https://github.com/christophevg/human-parser-generator) - this older project is (very slowly) getting a remake/sequel transitioning it from C# to... Python ðŸ˜‡

And please remember: everything in these repositories is all and only about software: it is software and/or enables building software. It's made mostly for fun and shared as openly as possible for others to enjoy.

Nothing more, nothing less.

So ... Be kind, be useful, live and let live.
