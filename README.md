# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Christophe VG](https://christophe.vg) and these repositories
contain my serious and less serious code ramblings. My interests are mainly
focused on software development as a trade and tooling to get things done.

I'm on this eternal quest to create my personal stack to be able to quickly
create whatever little application crosses my mind, because they come across
often and fast. So if I'm not done quickly enough, it ends up somewhere in
/dev/null ðŸ˜‡

Stay tuned...
