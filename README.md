# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Christophe VG](https://christophe.vg) and these repositories contain my serious and less serious code ramblings. My interests are mainly focused on software development as a trade and tooling to get things done.

I'm basically on this eternal quest to create my personal stack to be able to quickly create whatever little application crosses my mind. Because they come across often and fast, if I'm not done quickly enough, it ends up somewhere in /dev/null ðŸ˜‡

Since the early 80s, programming languages have always had an enormous attractive force on me, making me explore every single one I could lay my hands on. Notable highlights that got some more appreciation over time included PHP, Javascript, C,.. and around 2013 [Python](/search?q=owner%3Achristophevg+language%3APython&type=code) entered my [editor](https://macromates.com). Just like MacOS, it felt like the "where-have-you-been-all-my-life" experience all over again, making all other languages feel like some form of masochism.

Currently my (ever chaning) focus is on:

* [bpmn-tools](/christophevg/bpmn-tools) - my collection of Python modules to work with BPMN
* [pypi-template](/christophevg/pypi-template) - my semi-biased/personal template-based set of common & best practices for managing a Python project/package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/christophe.vg/) - I like consistency, so most of my (Python) projects/repos are based on it
* [baseweb](/christophevg/baseweb) - my unholy matrimony of Python and Vue(tify), also known as my personal ultra-rapid web-application development stack
* [human-parser-generator](/christophevg/human-parser-generator) - this older project is (very slowly) getting a remake/sequel transitioning it from C# to... Python ðŸ˜‡
